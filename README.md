My public code samples.

## Language Identification

Given a previously unseen piece of text as input, it attempts to
identify the language used based on character frequency from the
corpora supplied for each language.  Check out the README file for a
detailed description of all the files.  This was code I wrote for a
class, hence the reference to `asst6`.
