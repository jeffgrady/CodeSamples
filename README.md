# CodeSamples

My public code samples.

## Language Identification

Given a previously unseen piece of text as input, it attempts to
identify the language used based on character frequency from the
corpora supplied for each language.  Check out the README file for a
detailed description of all the files.  This was code I wrote for a
class, hence the reference to `asst6`.

## Linked List

This is just a simple linked list implementation to demonstrate
proficiency in C++.  Note that I would not write my own linked list
implementation in production code, there's too much high quality
existing code already out there.
