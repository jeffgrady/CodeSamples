### Manifest:

* README:  this file

* asst6.py:  Python code for Assignment 6

  To execute, simply type:

  $ ./asst6.py

  You may need to do this first:

  $ chmod 755 asst6.py

* asst6-output.txt:

  Redirection of ./asst6.py to a file.  You can see in the output that
  it does the one char look-ahead with test-data.txt and
  test-data-extension.txt, then the two char look-ahead with each test
  file.

* {english,german,french,italian,portuguese,spanish}.txt:

  Given corpuses for learning each language.

* extension_{english,german,french,italian,portuguese,spanish}.txt:

  Extended corpuses for learning each language downloaded from 
  Project Gutenberg.  They are not in ASCII but UTF-8 and are instead
  converted on the fly during learning.  See the code for details.

  Note:  The conversion code had some problems on Python 2.3.5 on OS X 
         10.4 (not sure of the exact version - it's old), but it has
         been tested on Python 2.5.1 on OS X 10.5 and on Python 2.5.2
         on nice.harvard.edu.

* test-data.txt:

  Supplied test data for the assignment.

* test-data-extension.txt:

  Extra test data crafted by me consisting of "A cat." and "The red
  cat sleeps." in each language as translated by Babelfish (not
  necessarily a correct translation), plus part of the first line of
  the US Constitution in each language.


### Performance:

The test-data.txt phrase, "Eu te amo." is consistently
mischaracterized as French instead of Portuguese, even with the two
character look-ahead.  I believe the input is too short to
appropriately analyze given the character similarity.  I believe it
would be entirely possible to assess if our approach was word-based
as opposed to character-based, though this would create a very large
matrix.

All other phrases and sentences from test-data.txt seem to be
correctly characterized.

I did manage to find a sentence that was not translated properly by
the one look-ahead but correctly by the two look-ahead:

Un chat.  ("A cat." in English)

The original one look-ahead thought it was German, the two look-ahead
correctly identified it as French.

Note that sometimes the two look-ahead sometimes did worse, especially
on the "A cat." phrases.  In general, short inputs seem unreliable.
More input data leads to a more specific determination of the
language.
